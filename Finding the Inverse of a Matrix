# Our Assignment for week 5 was the following:

# Find the value of inverse of a matrix, determinant of a matrix by using the following values:
# A=matrix(1:100, nrow=10)
# B=matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)

# However, this isn’t possible to do. When you use the solve() function to find the inverse, you get this error message:

A <- matrix(1:100, nrow=10)  

B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)

I1 <- solve(A)

I2 <- solve(B)

#Error in solve.default(A) : 
  #Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular: U[6,6] = 0
  
#This error means that the system has a determinant of zero. An inverse cannot be found with a determinant of zero. It must be a non-zero number.

#For Matrix B the error message shows as following:

#Error in solve.default(B) : 'a' (10 x 100) must be square

#In order for a Matrix to have an inverse, it must be a square. Matrix B is a rectangle due to it’s vast amounts of columns.

#Thus, neither Matrix A or Matrix B have an inverse.
